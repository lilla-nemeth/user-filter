# Corsearch Coding Assignment - Frontend (React, TypeScript)

Built with React, TypeScript, Next.js, Sass.

The Dashboard is located in the main app folder. Probably, if the project would have multiple pages I would place the Dashboard into a dashboard subfolder, optionally with a layout file. Dashboard should be a protected route, thus it would require authentication where the user would be redirected e.g from a Home page. In a bigger project with backend I would wrap the app in a frontend or client folder.

## Running the App

```bash
yarn dev
```
